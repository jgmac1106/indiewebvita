## Layout Options

This page is built using CSS Grid and flexbox. 

If you remove all background colors, and borders you can customize the design.

Each topic in the vita is layed out as its own grid so you should be able move around the pieces to highlight what you instutution is looking for.

## I Don't Know HTML

That is okay. The project is set up so can just touch what is inside the <opening> and </closing> HTML tags.
